# 8-Bit-Microcontroller-FPGA-Design

This project implements a custom 8-bit microcontroller on an FPGA using VHDL/Verilog.
It includes a simple RISC-style instruction set, an ALU, register file, program counter, control unit, and memory.
The complete design was simulated, synthesized, and tested on an FPGA board using tools like Xilinx Vivado.

This project was also presented at IEEE ICFT 2025, showcasing the architecture and FPGA implementation.
